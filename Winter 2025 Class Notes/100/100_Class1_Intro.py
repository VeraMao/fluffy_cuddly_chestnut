MACS 30100 Perspectives on Computational Modeling

Human Learning
- Brain perceives things from surroundings
- Process the perceived information and make rational decisions
- Learn from the past experiences and make better decisions in the future

Machine Learning
- Program the intelligent behavioral process of human brain to machine, make the machine to perform as humans

Supervised Learning
- Learn/Train a model from labeled data
- Apply the model to predict the class label for unseen data
Regression
- Predict continuous values
- featured variables and outcome variable
Classification
- Predict discrete values, binary classficiation or multi-class classification (spam or hand-written digit recognition)

Unsupervised Learning
- Learn from unlabeled data
- Discover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures
Clustering
- Group similar data points together
Dimensionality Reduction
- Reduce the number of features in a dataset

Difference: 

Semi-Supervised Learning
- small amount of labeled data and large amount of unlabeled data


Reinforcement Learning
- Learn from the consequences of actions
- Agent interacts with the environment
- Learn the optimal policy to maximize the reward
